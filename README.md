# GeneticPokerSquaresPlayer

Project for CS4725 Winter 2017.  As of writting this I haven't pushed the final submission yet.

The base code and example Monte Carlo player are given as part of the project by the professor.

This is an IntelliJ project, simply load it into IntelliJ, or take the Java files out and run it somewhere else.
